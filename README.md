# Figma Mockup to HTML and CSS

## Overview

This project is the result of my first attempt at creating a Figma mockup using HTML and CSS. I drew inspiration and ideas from a tutorial on FreeCodeCamp.org, and the process of translating a design into code was both challenging and rewarding.

## Features

- **HTML and CSS:** Translated the design into a functional webpage using HTML and CSS.
- **Learning Experience:** Overcame challenges and learned valuable skills during the project.
- **Style Variation:** Explored different styles to enhance the visual appeal.

## Challenges

- **Initial Learning Curve:** Grasping Figma and translating design to code was a learning curve.
- **Style Implementation:** Experimenting with various styles presented challenges but facilitated learning.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
